🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using SVM (Machine Learning)

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Python.


📌 Project Overview

Loaded the dataset

Performed data analysis

Split the dataset into training and test sets

Scaled the feature values

Trained an SVM (linear kernel) model

Calculated accuracy

Built a prediction system to check if a person is diabetic




🧠 Machine Learning Model Used

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Kernel used: linear

Best for binary classification problems like diabetes prediction

Works well when data is linearly separable
